	abstract = {Design requirement is as important in aerodynamic design as in other industries because it sets up the objective for the samples in design space to approach. Natural Laminar Flow (NLF) optimization belongs to the type of aerodynamic design problems featured by the combination of distinct aerodynamic performance, where the design requirement is often formulated in form of summation of laminar-related performance and pressure drag performance with different weight assignment according to different perspectives. However, the formulations are rather experience-oriented and are decided non-quantitatively. Inspired by data manipulation approaches in design space (spanned by design variables of geometrical representation parameters) in many aerodynamic designs, this paper proposes new formulations of design requirement in NLF optimization via consideration of objective space (projection of design space through aerodynamics) and shows the impact of the corresponding formulation of design requirement to the result of NLF optimization in cases of transonic airfoil and aero engine compressor blade design from two perspectives: Pareto front convergence and improving effect of accessory performance. The paper uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to obtain the eigenvectors of objective space to extract the intrinsic information about speciﬁc problem. The method is realized in two cases with satisfactory result.},

               is challenging due to the premature flow transition from the
               prominent crossflow instabilities (CFIs). Hence, natural laminar
               flow (NLF) wings are limited to lower sweep angles. In this
               study, hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) is used to extend this
               limit to design low-drag transonic infinite wing. A
               multi-objective genetic algorithm with competing drag components
               as objectives is used to design NLF and HLFC airfoils. Optimal
               design is a tradeoff between the drag reduction from skin
               friction drag, pressure drag, and suction drag, and does not
               resemble initial airfoils. Airfoil shape and suction

	abstract = {Natural laminar flow is one of the most promising ways to reduce the drag of future aircraft configurations. However, there is a lack of efficient tools for performing shape optimization considering laminar-to-turbulent transition. This is in part because including crossflow instabilities in the optimization is challenging. This paper addresses this need by developing a discrete, adjoint-based optimization framework where transition is modeled considering both Tollmien and Schlichting waves and crossflow instabilities. The framework is based on a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics solver coupled with a transition simulation module externally by incorporating into the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model through a smooth intermittency function. The transition simulation module consists of a laminar boundary-layer equations solver and a simplified stability analysis method based on the Drela–Giles method and the C1 criterion. A Jacobian-free coupledadjoint method is used to compute the gradients of the transition prediction. Lift-constrained drag minimization of a transonic infinite span wing with 25◦ of sweep is performed. The optimizer successfully reduces the drag coefficient by 43.34\%, owing to an extended laminar region on the wing surface, and finds a pressure distribution that strikes a balance between the Tollmien–Schlichting wave and crossflow instability transition mechanisms.},

The uncertainty in Ncr is represented by a negative half-normal probability distribution that descends from the largest Ncr achievable with an ideal surface and ﬂow quality. The uncertainty in various aerodynamic coefﬁcients due to the uncertainty in Ncr is quantiﬁed using the weighted mean and standard deviation of ﬂow solutions run at different Ncr values. The uncertainty in the aerofoil performance is assessed using this methodology. It is found that the standard deviation of the aerofoil performance due to the uncertainty in Ncr is largest when the transition location is most sensitive to changes in the lift coefﬁcient at the ideal Ncr. Robust shape optimisation is also carried out to improve the mean performance and reduce the standard deviation of the performance with uncertainty in Ncr. This is found to be effective at producing aerofoils with a larger amount of laminar ﬂow that are less sensitivity to uncertainty in Ncr. A trade-off is observed between the mean performance and the standard deviation of the performance. It is also found that reducing the standard deviation of the performance at one Mach number or lift coefﬁcient design point can cause an increase in the standard deviation off-design.},

	abstract = {Hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) can be a possible solution for future sustainable energy-efficient aviation. The current study proposes a MATLAB-based numerical tool for the design of the suction system for an airfoil optimized for a subsonic short-range HLFC application. Considerable energy losses may occur when the air passes through the perforated metallic outer surface and the inner structure of the suction system. A semi-empirical approach is used to design a layout that provides a target suction velocity based on measured pressure losses through porous medium and substructures. Flowbench measurements were performed on 3D-printed internal core test samples to quantify the pressure losses that can be used to create a lower pressure below the porous sheet matching the target suction velocity. The actual suction realized on the airfoil using this substructure concept has a discrete nature that increases with the distance between two adjacent walls. Finally, the suction system’s power requirement is calculated. The power requirement for distributed suction accounts for the pressure loss characteristics of the porous material, the internal core structure, and throttling holes. However, the study does not include the ducting losses from the substructure to the compressor. Approximately 80\% of the total suction power is utilized to eject the sucked air back to the freestream conditions for a system with a compressor and propulsive system efficiency equal to one. The study analyses the performance of the designed internal core layout to different flight conditions and addresses the suction power requirement variation with lift coefficient and flight altitude.},

	abstract = {Receptivity, disturbance growth and breakdown to turbulence in Go¨rtler ﬂow are studied by spatial direct numerical simulation (DNS). The boundary layer is exposed to free-stream vortical modes and localized wall roughness. We propose a normalization of the roughness-induced receptivity coeﬃcient by the square root of the Go¨rtler number. This scaling removes the dependence of the receptivity coeﬃcient on wall curvature. It is found that vortical modes are more eﬃcient at generating Go¨rtler vortices than localized roughness. The boundary layer is most receptive to zeroand low-frequency free-stream vortices, exciting steady and slowly travelling Go¨rtler modes. The associated receptivity mechanism is linear and involves the generation of boundary-layer streaks, which soon evolve into unstable Go¨rtler vortices. This connection between transient and exponential ampliﬁcation is absent on ﬂat plates and promotes transition to turbulence on curved walls. We demonstrate that the Go¨rtler boundary layer is also receptive to high-frequency free-stream vorticity, which triggers steady Go¨rtler rolls via a nonlinear receptivity mechanism. In addition to the receptivity study, we have carried out DNS of boundary-layer transition due to broadband free-stream turbulence with diﬀerent intensities and frequency spectra. It is found that nonlinear receptivity dominates over the linear mechanism unless the free-stream ﬂuctuations are concentrated in the low-frequency range. In the latter case, transition is accelerated due to the presence of travelling Go¨rtler modes.},

Some of the important drivers for such interests include high fuel prices, less emissions requirements, need for more environment friendly aircraft to lessen the global warming effects. Hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) technology is promising and offers possibility to achieve these goals. This technology was researched for decades for its application in transport aircraft, and it has achieved a new level of maturity towards integration and safety and maintenance aspects. This paper aims to give an overview of HLFC systems research and associated flight tests in the past years both in the US and in Europe. The review makes it possible to distinguish between the successful approaches and the less successful or outdated approaches in HLFC research. Furthermore, the technology status shall try to produce first estimations regarding the mass, power consumption and performance of HLFC systems as well as estimations regarding maintenance requirements and possible subsystem definitions.},

Of the three, impact on climate change is taken to have the greatest longterm importance and is discussed at the greatest length. It is argued that, of the three main contributors to climate change from aircraft –CO2 emissions, NOX emissions and the creation of persistent contrails – it is the last two which are the most promising targets. Ways of reducing the impacts of these two are discussed and it is noted that, in each case, the best environmental result is likely to entail some increase in CO2 emissions. It follows that regulatory or economic measures to reduce impact on climate should be framed so as to do just that. Measures framed purely in terms of CO2 emissions are likely to be counter-productive. Nevertheless, the design of aircraft to reduce fuel burn and hence CO2 emission remains a key long-term objective; the essay considers the potential offered by new technology and new design concepts in this arena.},

            The use of flow control (FC) technology on civil transport aircraft is seen as a potential means of providing a step change in aerodynamic performance in the 2020 time frame. There has been extensive research into the flow physics associated with FC. This paper focuses on developing an understanding of the costs and design drivers associated with the systems needed and certification. The research method adopted is based on three research strands:
            1. Study of the historical development of other disruptive technologies for civil transport aircraft,
            2. Analysis of the impact of legal and commercial requirements, and
            3. Technological foresight based on technology trends for aircraft currently under development.
            Fly by wire and composite materials are identified as two historical examples of successful implementation of disruptive new technology. Both took decades to develop, and were initially developed for military markets. The most widely studied technology similar to FC is identified as laminar flow control. Despite more than six decades of research and arguably successful operational demonstration in the 1990s this has not been successfully transitioned to commercial products. Significant future challenges are identified in cost effective provision of the additional systems required for environmental protection and in service monitoring of FC systems particularly where multiple distributed actuators are envisaged. FC generated noise is also seen as a significant challenge. Additional complexity introduced by FC systems must also be balanced by the commercial imperative of dispatch reliability, which may impose more stringent constraints than legal (certification) requirements. It is proposed that a key driver for future successful application of FC is the likely availability of significant electrical power generation on 787 aircraft forwards. This increases the competitiveness of electrically driven FC systems compared with those using engine bleed air. At the current rate of progress it is unlikely FC will make a contribution to the next generation of single-aisle aircraft due to enter service in 2015. In the longer term, there needs to be significant movement across a broad range of systems technologies before the aerodynamic benefits of FC can be exploited.},

If these opportunities are pursued, the aircraft in production in 2050 could be very different from those of 2005. It is for the aerodynamicists, supported by the structures and systems engineers and the materials scientists, to make the case for a radical leap.},

The tool provides accurate results, but without the high computational cost of high-fidelity tools. The solver combines the use of an Euler flow solver characterized by an integral boundary-layer method and linear stability analysis using a [Formula: see text] approximation for transition prediction. In particular, a conical transformation is adopted, including the determination of the shock-wave position. The solver is implemented in a multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) framework, including wing weight estimation and aircraft performance analysis. The framework consists of different modules: aerodynamics, structure, suction system analysis, and performance evaluation. Using a genetic algorithm and considering HLFC technology, wing MDO has been performed to find the optimum wing planform and airfoil shape. A backward-swept wing (BSW) aircraft, developed inside the Cluster of Excellence–Sustainable and Energy Efficient Aviation ([Formula: see text]A) is studied. Novel technologies such as active flow control, limited maximum load factors due to load alleviation, and novel materials allow a fuel weight reduction of 6\%.},

Surface imperfections, implemented as combination of gap and forward-facing step, caused transition to occur at a location more upstream than in the case of a smooth surface (i.e. without gap and step). For this combination of imperfections, it was demonstrated for the first time in experiments that suction, achieved passively by exploiting the pressure difference between upper and lower side of the model, induced a movement of transition to a more downstream location than without suction, and in most cases even more downstream than on the smooth configuration at the same test conditions. Thus, the effect of suction was to even overcompensate the adverse effect of the combination of gap and forward-facing step on boundary-layer transition for the investigated test conditions.},

To this end, compressibility corrections are developed and investigated to extend commonly used empirical correlations to transonic ﬂight conditions while retaining their accuracy at low speeds. A compressibility correction for Tollmien-Schlichting instabilities is developed and applied to a smooth local correlation-based transition model and a stationary crossﬂow instability compressibility correction is included by adding a new crossﬂow source term function. Two- and three-dimensional transonic transition test cases demonstrate that the Tollmien-Schlichting compressibility correction produces substantially improved agreement with the experimental transition locations, particularly for higher Reynolds number applications where the eﬀects of ﬂow compressibility are expected to be more significant, such as the NASA CRM-NLF wing-body conﬁguration, while the crossﬂow compressibility correction prevents an inaccurate, upstream transition front. The compressibility corrections and modiﬁcations do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the numerical behaviour of the model, which provides an eﬃcient alternative to non-local and higher-ﬁdelity approaches, and can be applied to other transport-equation-based transition models with low-speed empirical correlations without aﬀecting their predictive capability in the incompressible regime.},

	abstract = {This paper presents progress towards a transition modelling capability for use in the numerical solution of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations that provides accurate predictions for transonic ﬂows and is thus suitable for use in the design of wings for aircraft ﬂying at transonic speeds. To this end, compressibility corrections are developed and investigated to extend commonly used empirical correlations to transonic ﬂight conditions while retaining their accuracy at low speeds. A compressibility correction for Tollmien-Schlichting instabilities is developed and applied to a smooth local correlation-based transition model and a stationary crossﬂow instability compressibility correction is included by adding a new crossﬂow source term function. Two- and three-dimensional transonic transition test cases demonstrate that the Tollmien-Schlichting compressibility correction produces substantially improved agreement with the experimental transition locations, particularly for higher Reynolds number applications where the eﬀects of ﬂow compressibility are expected to be more significant, such as the NASA CRM-NLF wing-body conﬁguration, while the crossﬂow compressibility correction prevents an inaccurate, upstream transition front. The compressibility corrections and modiﬁcations do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the numerical behaviour of the model, which provides an eﬃcient alternative to non-local and higher-ﬁdelity approaches, and can be applied to other transport-equation-based transition models with low-speed empirical correlations without aﬀecting their predictive capability in the incompressible regime.},

                An integrated approach is applied to geometry parameterization

                refinement and redistribution techniques are introduced to

  abstract  = "Designing transonic laminar swept wing at high Reynolds numbers
               is challenging due to the premature flow transition from the
               prominent crossflow instabilities (CFIs). Hence, natural laminar
               flow (NLF) wings are limited to lower sweep angles. In this
               study, hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) is used to extend this
               limit to design low-drag transonic infinite wing. A
               multi-objective genetic algorithm with competing drag components
               as objectives is used to design NLF and HLFC airfoils. Optimal
               design is a tradeoff between the drag reduction from skin
               friction drag, pressure drag, and suction drag, and does not
               resemble initial airfoils. Airfoil shape and suction
               distribution are coupled and optimized simultaneously. Euler
               flow solver with integral boundary-layer method is coupled with
               a higher-fidelity Linear Stability Analysis using 2.5D
               approximation for transition prediction. At wing sweep of 22.5°,
               Mach number of 0.78, and Reynolds number of 30 million, optimum
               NLF airfoil has 27\% lower drag than an optimum turbulent
               airfoil. The optimum HLFC airfoil showed a 25\% lower total drag
               than the NLF airfoil. A higher optimum sweep angle was observed
               for low-drag HLFC airfoil (20.5°) in comparison to the NLF
               airfoil (16.8°) and both favored an undercut on the lower
